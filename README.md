# Third Party to Intervals.icu

### TrainerRoad Updates ⚠️

I don't have access to TrainerRoad anymore. Account, which I used, cancelled subscription. I don't use the platform and it's too expensive to have it for occasional fixes.
To fix issues I can only relay on logs and HAR files from you.

## FAQ

* Only duration based steps in workouts are supported, the app can't work with distance based steps
* Ramp steps in TrainerRoad are not supported
* **MacOS** app is not signed. Usually you need to open it twice. After opening it, be patient, it takes some time to
  start
* **Windows** The app will ask to access local network and Internet, you need to allow it. After all it makes HTTP requests
* In case of any problems. You can create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/freekode/tp2intervals/issues)
  or write directly to me iam@freekode.org. Add logs from your app, it can help a lot to resolve the issue. Or in case of TrainerRoad create HAR file
* More info you can find on the forum https://forum.intervals.icu/t/tp2intervals-copy-trainingpeaks-and-trainerroad-workouts-plans-to-intervals/63375

### Scheduling for the next day with TrainingPeaks free account
Officially you can't plan workouts for future dates, but practically you can plan workout for tomorrow with free TP account.
You can plan workout for the next day relative to TP server local time. TP server local time is in UTC-6 time zone.

E.g your TZ is UTC+2, current local datetime 20.05.2024 06:00. TP server local datetime is 19.05.2024 22:00. You can plan workouts for 20.05.2024, you can't plan workouts for 21.05.2024, you can do it in 2 hours.

E.g your TZ is UTC+12, current local datetime 20.05.2024 18:00. TP server local datetime is 20.05.2024 00:00. You can plan workouts for 21.05.2024.
